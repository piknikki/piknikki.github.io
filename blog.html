                <h4>Nikki: 1, Heroku: 0 </h4>
                <h5><em>Date: July 17, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>
                    I shouldn't say that I won over Heroku, because when I can get my shit deployed, we all win (even Heroku).
                    But holy crap can it be a struggle to get things to work when deploying!
                </p>

                <p>
                    So I guess this post should be about problem solving and grit. I have a lot of feelings about grit, and
                    I wrote about them on a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-grit-like-boss-nikki-petersen-csm/">
                    LinkedIn,</a> so let's focus on problem solving here.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was using a tutorial to learn some Redux to go with my React knowledge, and I had completed the entire
                    course. It took me about 2 weeks, from start to finish. I learned a lot, solidified knowledge that I
                    learned a while back, and got some new tips/tricks from the developer teaching the course. It was
                    muy bueno. But then . . . Heroku. ü§™ ü§™ ü§™
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first problem was that I was unfamiliar with a post-production script build instead of a local build and
                    then pushing the build. So that was fun, to learn how easy it is to do that -- just add a script in
                    the package.json, make sure your secrets are tightly kept in a config and .gitignore situation, and then
                    push it!  Wheee!  (that's really not all; there are other changes that need to be made, but I'm too
                    tired to put them all down; like making sure your process.env.NODE_ENV is set to 'production'; etc. etc.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    I pushed to my master and to Heroku's master, the build was confirmed, and Heroku says . . . no. üôÖ
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why, Heroku? Why you do me this way??  ü•∫
                </p>

                <p>
                    When this happens, you need to look, listen, and ask questions. Look at the Heroku logs or any other
                    errors you may be getting. Listen to what google and stack overflow are saying. If you look at the
                    errors but don't know how to solve them, ask experts!  Use google and stack overflow because it is
                    pretty much guaranteed that someone else has had the *exact* same problem before -- or at least something
                    close enough that you can adapt a solution to your problem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So my last step in this problem solving process was to be patient with Heroku. It takes a while to
                    finish its biz when you've made changes. Give it time to do the magic. And when I say time, I mean more
                    than 60 seconds, which is like, f o r e v e r when you're trying to diagnose a problem with deploying!
                    I know. I feel your pain. But try to be patient. I had made some fixes, and tried reloading but it
                    wasn't working. 5 minutes later, I tried a refresh and there was my app. Magic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The problem with that is that I don't know which solution ended up fixing the problem. Was it adding
                    node and npm versions to the package.json file? Or was it adding the variables to Heroku's config?
                    The answer is, probably all the things are the solution. But I wasn't patient enough to let them
                    percolate through Heroku.  üòù ü§Ø üò© üò§ ü§¨ üôè üôå üíÜ

                <h4>4th of July </h4>
                <h5><em>Date: July 12, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>
                    I took a few days off and spent the holiday with my brother and his fiance. It was really nice.
                    The kids had a great time and I relaxed a bit. Then, this week, I had a quick phone call for a job
                    screening (first step in a job interview for a developer position). It went very (very) well, and I
                    received the next steps:  do a cognitive test, a personality test, a take-home coding challenge, and a
                    behavioral assessment. That all went swimmingly, and now I'm waiting to hear about an interview next
                    week!  Eek!
                </p>

                <p>
                    So that's all fun and exciting. I was challenged by the code challenge, and not in a way that I like.
                    I like being challenged, but when I figure out the solution and it's suuuuuuper easy, I just kick
                    myself! I hate that. All part of the process, I guess.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Otherwise, I've been working on a project that has front and back end, login and registration (so
                    lots of authentication goodness), and using Redux. I've not learned that as of yet, so it's also
                    challenging me right now. All the challenges.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And in the middle of all that, I did an install (yarn) so that I could work with the take-home challenge,
                    and it BORKED my node.js!!!  GRRRRRR!! I finally got it worked out by uninstalling node and doing some
                    other diagnostic shenanigans, and then reinstalling it. Had to update Homebrew, unlink that stupid bin file
                    that was not unlinking itself when I uninstalled, and other such nonsense. Finally got node back up
                    and figured I'd do a restart, crossing my fingers that the computer wouldn't explode when it all came
                    back up.  Seems good so far.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I guess the moral of this story is that stuff happens and you have to roll with it. Yes, this tangent
                    has sidetracked me by about 2 hours, and yes, I thought the world was ending roughly around 1.5 hours ago.
                    Did it end?? Nope. Am I wiser for having struggled through that challenge? Not really. It was dumb. Dependencies.
                    Boo. But am I feeling better about my skills and abilities to deal when the shit hits the fan at maximum
                    borkdrive? Yes. I. Am.  ü¶Ñ

                <h4>Interviewing to be a dev </h4>
                <h5><em>Date: July 10, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>I'm trying to find a job right now, so interviewing is slowly becoming part of my weekly schedule.
                Interviews for developers are very different from any other position I've ever interviewed for. One particularly
                spectacular interview experience I've had so far was with Help Scout. First off, their application was
                basically a behavioral interview online. How cool is that?! It gave me the opportunity to shine in my
                writing and emotional intelligence splendor. I was practically glowing after I finished it. They liked me,
                so they interviewed me by video and the feedback I received afterwards was like GOLD.
                </p>

                <p>First, they said that I am üíØ a good fit for the culture of this startup. That feels SO good to hear!
                    I love it when a company is so closely aligned with my values (they were a good fit for me, as well as
                    I was for them). Sadly, they couldn't hire me, because they needed someone more senior. Cool. I'll
                    get more experience and come back, because I know I want to work with you!!  ü§©
                </p>

                <p>But the most important part of that experience was the feedback. These days it's close to impossible
                    to connect with anyone in HR of any company, which is super frustrating. I'm applying to companies that
                    are big enough to support a junior developer like myself, so that means they're typically using an
                    applicant tracking system and a job portal, which means I have no way to find out who works in HR so
                    I can contact them if I have a problem or question. That seems silly to me.
                </p>

                <p>Anyway . . . so another interview process I'm going through has about 5 steps (at least that's how many
                    I've encountered so far, perhaps there will be more):  15 min phone call, cognitive assessment,
                    personality assessment, take-home coding challenge, behavioral assessment, and then an in person
                    interview. I'm also enjoying this process because I like the cognitive challenges and the coding stuff
                    that I can do at home. I have test anxiety and doing white boarding <em>freaks me out</em>!! So being able
                    to do it in my own home is lovely.  ü§ì
                </p>

                <p>I guess there's not really a point here, just writing about my experiences so far. I'm enjoying it, but
                    obviously would much rather have a job (instead of my job being finding a job).

                <h1 class="rainbow">GitHub pdf for collaborating (read and download)  </h1>
                <h4>A somewhat helpful guide??</h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 28, 2019</em></h5>

                <p><em>Click on the image below to go to my GitHub and then click on "download" in the upper right.</em></p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/piknikki/piknikki.github.io/blob/master/GitFlow.pdf"><img id="gitflow" src="images/gitflow.png" alt="gitflow download"></a>
                </p>

                <p>In preparation for teaching a new tutoring student about how to collaborate with GitHub, I created a
                    pdf of a flow chart for working with others and how GitHub works. This is the description that goes with that
                    instructional and super helpful pdf.
                </p>
                <p>Ok, on the first page, I have "my repo" in purple-ish blue. It shows how, using the git commands, I can
                do my own git version control in my repo. I can create a repo on GitHub and go from there, or I can create one locally,
                then add the remote and push up to my GitHub.</p>

                <p>On the second page, you can see your repo, which is, you guessed it, the same thing! You can do your own
                    version control with git in your own repo. Yay!
                </p>

                <p>The last page shows how we would collaborate together, assuming that I create (and thus own) the original
                    repo. You could either clone or fork my repo:  cloning copies the repo to your local machine, whereas
                    forking copies the repo to your GitHub. With the former scenario, your local copy is intrinsically your
                    working directory and your local repo; you would make changes and then you could create a pull request
                    (after add, commit, and push). With the latter scenario, your copy is on GitHub, so you'll need to
                    clone it to your local machine in order to work on it. Then, as with cloning, you can add, commit, push,
                    and then make a pull request. This all assumes that the final product will be on my repo (my GitHub).
                </p>

                <p>Let's say that you wanted to keep it to yourself. For example, I've worked on projects with a group, and after
                    we're done and deployed, and they wanted to make changes and deploy to their own Heroku or other platform. Cool.
                    Then you would just fork my repo and go from there on your own GitHub without creating a pull request.

                <h1 class="rainbow">Tutoring as a part-time gig -- yay!</h1>
                <h4>Supporting students </h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 28, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>I've been offline for a few days because I was prepping for an interview to become a tutor. I'll be
                    tutoring students in boot camps like the one I just completed (Full Stack Software Development). I'm
                    pretty excited about this opportunity for a number of reasons.
                </p>
                <p>First, I get to help people. That's my jam! But also, I get to learn. Yes, I'm tutoring students new to
                    software development, but I'll be learning. Or at least, I'd better be learning! I don't believe that
                    learning is ever complete, no matter how much education you have or how old you are. Life is a school,
                    and every experience I have is teaching me new things about the world -- incidentally, I LOVE that!!
                </p>

                <p>So I'm developing some curriculum of my own, to be able to illustrate lessons the way I can best convey
                    them. That's fun, because I get to be creative.
                </p>

                <p>At the same time, I still need to keep learning about testing, PWAs, mobile app development, etc., etc.
                    There's so much to keep learning! That's one of the benefits of learning development and programming,
                    in my opinion. I can usually look at a job and see the point at which I'll have mastered it and then get
                    bored with it. But I don't see that with development. I also don't see that with coaching. I am SO
                    anxious to get into coaching development teams! I just can't wait! I need experience with development and
                    then I can move into management of dev teams, and eventually coaching dev teams.
                </p>

                <p>It just can't happen fast enough.  ü¶î</p>

                <h1 class="rainbow">Testing -- Bug lifecycle and a bunch of testing concepts</h1>
                <h4>My first basic learning steps in testing</h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 27, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>I've starting learning some things about testing, and want to write about what I've learned (to reinforce
                    the learning).
                </p>
                <p><em><strong>Bug Lifecycle</strong></em>:  This is pretty self-explanatory once you look at it. Obviously,
                    someone needs to report a bug, and that's when it gets put into a tracking system as "new". Then it
                    is assigned to a developer, who changes the status to "active" if they believe it is truly a bug, and
                    "rejected" if they don't. The latter may be the case if a QA Tester doesn't understand the requirements
                    or if the feature is working, just not as the tester expected. If the bug is accepted and active, the
                    developer works on a fix and then tests the feature. If it fails at this point, the bug can be reopened
                    and goes back into the flow as "active"; if it passes, the status is changed to "verified" and then it's
                    closed.
                </p>
                <p><em><strong>Black box testing</strong></em>:  this type of testing is performed when the tester does not
                    know the "inner workings" of the feature. Examples of black box testing include: equivalence testing
                    (representatives from each partition are selected; an additional note is that the tester will want to
                    confirm both positive and negative test cases (i.e. valid and invalid cases), boundary testing
                    (edge cases, and cases on either side
                    of the partitions), decision tables (created using the test conditions to build a matrix of possible outcomes),
                    state transition (when the feature changes state, like login/logout), and use cases (specific scenarios).
                </p>
                <p><em><strong>White box testing</strong></em>:  this type of testing is performed when the tester understands and
                    knows the inner code and how the feature is built by the developer. Examples of white box testing include unit testing
                    and statement testing.
                </p>

                <p><em><strong>Smoke & Sanity checks</strong></em>:  Smoke testing tests the basic and most important functionality
                    of a feature or site, and can be a major cost saver because it gets the MVP features tested right away.
                    Sanity checks are just what it sounds like: does this make sense??
                </p>

                <p><em><strong>Regression testing</strong></em>:  aka verification testing. This is used to confirm that
                    bug fixes that have been made haven't broken other parts of the code or feature.
                </p>

                <p><em><strong>Other testing concepts</strong></em>:  Risk-based testing basically assesses risks and gets
                    people with different perspectives involved in asking questions about risk. Static testing assesses functionality
                    of the software without running it (and might even be considered "code review", whereas dynamic
                    testing runs the software (executes the code). Static is used earlier in the development life cycle,
                    and dynamic is used later.
                </p>
                <p>As a last thought here, it should be fairly obvious that planning testing and estimation should be just as detailed as
                    planning the development of software itself. What to test, how to test, how long testing should take, etc.
                    will all need to be thought through early (and be adjusted as necessary throughout the process). This is
                    where scrum and agile can help out, using techniques to estimate the complexity and energy required to
                    complete a task (not necessarily time or people, but what it will take to get something done -- and what
                    the definition of "done" actually is!).  ü•û ü•ì

                <h1 class="rainbow">Scrum & Agile are what floats my boat</h1>
                <h4>All the feels </h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 20, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>Although I have been studying software development for a bit under a year, I came to it somewhat
                    reluctantly. I started this part of my journey because I am driven to be a Scrum Master or development
                    team coach. After obtaining certification as a Scrum Master, I wasn't able to find a job and I asked around
                    to other SMs as to why, and their answer was that I needed development experience first. So that's what
                    I've been doing for the last year or so. I can admit that
                    as much as I enjoy development, it is not my passion. Helping people is my passion. And I guess I feel like
                    building apps doesn't achieve quite the tangible impact that I want to have. (not that there's anything wrong
                    with dev being your jam, if it is)

                </p>
                <p>Coaching is my peanut butter AND jam. I've gone from coaching one CEO, to coaching individuals in my private
                    practice (I was coaching gifted adults), and now I want to coach development teams. Supporting a team
                    allows me to use emotional intelligence to help others -- and I get to use intuition, common sense,
                    curiosity, and problem solving to do it. If I can make a team member feel good by feeling supported
                    and respected, I also get to feel good, and we both win. When that team member feels good, they can
                    do their very best work, which makes the client feel good.  Win-win-win!!
                </p>
                <p>One of the most important aspects of scrum is that the scrum master is a servant leader. That means truly
                    serving the people you're supporting. In my position leading a nonprofit, that meant finding board members
                    and then giving the everything they needed in order to be successful, from helping them define goals to
                    overcoming challenges in achieving those goals. In parenting, that means telling my kids that they can do
                    something and then letting them do it! Servant Leadership involves trust, respect, and empathy; it takes
                    patience, creates space for mistakes and learning from those mistakes, and relies on the assumption
                    that we are all doing our best.
                </p>

                <p>Doesn't that sound awesome??  ü¶ù

                <h1 class="rainbow">Bootcamps *le sigh* </h1>
                <h4>My experience left me lacking . . .</h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 19, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>I just finished a bootcamp in Full Stack Software Development, and you may know about the challenges that
                    this can create for a new developer. Yes, many developers these days are self-taught and plenty have received
                    their education through bootcamps. There are apprenticeships, bootcamps, online learning, library books,
                    YouTube, and (I'm sure) a billion more ways to learn how to code. As a recent graduate looking for a job,
                    I want to know how competitive I am and what skills I'm lacking. I'm a huge fan of Agile, so I always want to
                    be iterating and improving my knowledge base. Learning doesn't stop (like, ever) for me.
                </p>
                <p>So when I was looking around at other methods of education for a developer, I was noticing that my bootcamp
                    experience left a few holes in my education. The full time, immersive
                    bootcamp experience is a glorified glossing-over of basic subjects and (in my opinion) some topics that are
                    not necessarily essential. In other words, I felt like less time should be spent on things like Handlebars and
                    more time on deeper investigation of bigger topics like JavaScript and React. Although JavaScript was essentially
                    used after the second week, it wasn't really taught in depth. And React received all of two weeks (the first was
                    instruction, the second was final project time).

                </p>
                <p>Other than the lack of depth, one of the major holes in my experience was in testing. There was zero
                    teaching about testing. So I'll be filling in that gap myself, by learning about mobile, backend, and web testing,
                    and generally the subject of QA testing. I hope to cover JIRA and Confluence, and hopefully more. I'll
                    write about testing as soon as I have learned a bit.  :)

                <h4>My own personal Scrum</h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 18, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>Yesterday, I had jury duty and I had previously taken the weekend off (beginning Friday), so I'm feeling
                    a bit rusty right now. Yes, taking four days off can leave me feeling rusty.
                </p>
                <p>At any rate, here's what I'm up to: I got my blog written up in html/css and started writing a few posts.
                    I'll leave posts about OOP/FP and code conventions for tomorrow and the next day.
                    Today, I'll probably need to get started on either a review of full stack basic principles or get
                    started on learning testing methods and software. Both are large tasks. I would estimate that a full stack
                    review will take me one week, and learning testing will also take me one week. I may have to rock-paper-scissors
                    to make a decision.

                </p>
                <p>Challenges I'm facing include: the scroll bar at the bottom of my website is really bugging me, and
                    I need to decide on what to do next and then start it.</p>

                <h1 class="rainbow">Tackling a Topic one thought at a time</h1>
                <h4>HTML, CSS, and JS</h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 18, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>This discussion is about the basic trinity of web development:  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is
                    where the journey begins; it is the structure or the scaffolding on which we build a web page or an app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML is, of course, an acronym. Side note: learning to code is no different from learning medicine, in that
                    it is basically learning a new language. Every new language has its own precarious set of acronyms.
                    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it consists of tags that determine what will be placed
                    on the page in the browser. It's not fancy, but it's the backbone of anything you see on the web; it is the
                    starting place for any and all websites, web pages, and web applications. HTML may seem simple, but
                    it is essential for any web page to "work" (i.e. be seen by the user).
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS, (also an acronym) stands for Custom Styling Sheets, and it is how we create a bit of zhoosh for the
                    HTML we have. CSS is the sparkle, the glitter, and the icing on the cake. It allows us to place
                    elements in special locations on the page, change colors and fonts, and basically
                    transform boring cake into a work of art. To learn more about CSS, I have delved into a few different
                    ways to use it, like SCSS and BEM. I'll profile those in another article.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript (JS) is where things start to get real (and complex). JS allows users to interact with
                    the web page or application (HTML and CSS create static content -- it's not interactive).
                    JS makes buttons clickable, allows content to be dynamically updated, and animates images.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we go a step beyond the "holy trinity", we find APIs (Application Programming Interface). APIs are
                    the zhoosh to JavaScript -- they create extra power and functionality to JS by using additional code. It's like
                    borrowing someone else's Legos to build your house (but the Legos are reusable and can be shared
                    around the world).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ok, this was just a basic surface-scratching post, to get things started. My creative juices are
                    in desperate need of refreshing, because technical writing is turning out to be harder than I had
                    anticipated it would be.

                <p>I am going to write about the topics I'm learning. I just finished a bootcamp in Full Stack
                    Software Development, but I don't feel like I have all the knowledge that I should. So as I learn
                    those topics, I'll write about them here (to solidify the learning). When I was in medical school, the
                    basic teaching methodology was "see one, do one, teach one." I guess this is just my "teach one" forum.

                I am Nikki Petersen. I live in the Denver metro area and I have spent a little less than a year teaching
                myself Software Development. My experience includes: HTML/CSS, Bootstrap,
                JavaScript, JQuery, Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, Mongo/Mongoose, Handlebars,
                EJS, React, and a handful of other random packages/libraries/etc. I spend my professional free
                time continually learning. Right now, I'm adding testing methods and practices to my skillset.
                Personal free time is spent outdoors with my kids, learning and creating and generally engaging in
                shenanigans.
                <br><br>

                On a more personal note:  the last year or so has been a huge growth spurt for me, in terms of self-awareness.
                After being married to a man for 10-ish years, divorcing him, and then his death, I was finally able to come
                out and be myself for the first time since childhood. It seems like a lot of women have recently been coming out after
                being married and having children, and I have to say that my experience has been comparatively smooth. I'm lucky to have great
                friends who support me no matter what (unconditional love ftw), and I've never had to deal with the chaos of
                coming out to my horrible ex and his horrible family. So many women coming out late in life have very
                different outcomes. For me, it's been humbling to be so loved and cared for by my friends and family. Love is love.
                I often like to represent my journey with a "backward" rainbow of hearts because I've come out in a sort of
                reverse order, having lived one life for so long and finally being able to be my full self.</p>
