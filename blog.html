                <h2>Daily Standup</h2>
                <h4>My own personal Scrum</h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 18, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>Yesterday, I had jury duty and I had previously taken the weekend off (beginning Friday), so I'm feeling
                    a bit rusty right now. Yes, taking four days off can leave me feeling rusty.
                </p>
                <p>At any rate, here's what I'm up to: I got my blog written up in html/css and started writing a few posts.
                    I'll leave posts about OOP/FP and code conventions for tomorrow and the next day.
                    Today, I'll probably need to get started on either a review of full stack basic principles or get
                    started on learning testing methods and software. Both are large tasks. I would estimate that a full stack
                    review will take me one week, and learning testing will also take me one week. I may have to rock-paper-scissors
                    to make a decision.

                </p>
                <p>Challenges I'm facing include: the scroll bar at the bottom of my website is really bugging me, and
                    I need to decide on what to do next and then start it.</p>

                <h2>Tackling a Topic</h2>
                <h4>HTML, CSS, and JS</h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 18, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>This discussion is about the basic trinity of web development:  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is
                    where the journey begins; it is the structure or the scaffolding on which we build a web page or an app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML is, of course, an acronym. Side note: learning to code is no different from learning medicine, in that
                    it is basically learning a new language. Every new language has its own precarious set of acronyms.
                    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it consists of tags that determine what will be placed
                    on the page in the browser. It's not fancy, but it's the backbone of anything you see on the web; it is the
                    starting place for any and all websites, web pages, and web applications. HTML may seem simple, but
                    it is essential for any web page to "work" (i.e. be seen by the user).
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS, (also an acronym) stands for Custom Styling Sheets, and it is how we create a bit of zhoosh for the
                    HTML we have. CSS is the sparkle, the glitter, and the icing on the cake. It allows us to place
                    elements in special locations on the page, change colors and fonts, and basically
                    transform boring cake into a work of art. To learn more about CSS, I have delved into a few different
                    ways to use it, like SCSS and BEM. I'll profile those in another article.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript (JS) is where things start to get real (and complex). JS allows users to interact with
                    the web page or application (HTML and CSS create static content -- it's not interactive).
                    JS makes buttons clickable, allows content to be dynamically updated, and animates images.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we go a step beyond the "holy trinity", we find APIs (Application Programming Interface). APIs are
                    the zhoosh to JavaScript -- they create extra power and functionality to JS by using additional code. It's like
                    borrowing someone else's Legos to build your house (but the Legos are reusable and can be shared
                    around the world).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ok, this was just a basic surface-scratching post, to get things started. My creative juices are
                    in desperate need of refreshing, because technical writing is turning out to be harder than I had
                    anticipated it would be.
                </p>

                <h4>Initial Commit</h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 15, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>I am going to write about the topics I'm learning. I just finished a bootcamp in Full Stack
                    Software Development, but I don't feel like I have all the knowledge that I should. So as I learn
                    those topics, I'll write about them here (to solidify the learning). When I was in medical school, the
                    basic teaching methodology was "see one, do one, teach one." I guess this is just my "teach one" forum.

                I am Nikki Petersen. I live in the Denver metro area and I have spent a little less than a year teaching
                myself Software Development. My experience includes: HTML/CSS, Bootstrap,
                JavaScript, JQuery, Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, Mongo/Mongoose, Handlebars,
                EJS, React, and a handful of other random packages/libraries/etc. I spend my professional free
                time continually learning. Right now, I'm adding testing methods and practices to my skillset.
                Personal free time is spent outdoors with my kids, learning and creating and generally engaging in
                shenanigans.
                <br><br>

                On a more personal note:  the last year or so has been a huge growth spurt for me, in terms of self-awareness.
                After being married to a man for 10-ish years, divorcing him, and then his death, I was finally able to come
                out and be myself for the first time since childhood. It seems like a lot of women have recently been coming out after
                being married and having children, and I have to say that my experience has been comparatively smooth. I'm lucky to have great
                friends who support me no matter what (conditional love ftw), and I've never had to deal with the chaos of
                coming out to my horrible ex and his horrible family. So many women coming out late in life have very
                different outcomes. For me, it's been humbling to be so loved and cared for by my friends and family. Love is love.
                I often like to represent my journey with a "backward" rainbow of hearts because I've come out in a sort of
                reverse order, having lived one life for so long and finally being able to be my full self.</p>
