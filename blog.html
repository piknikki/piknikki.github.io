                <h1 class="rainbow">Tutoring as a part-time gig -- yay!</h1>
                <h4>Supporting students </h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 28, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>I've been offline for a few days because I was prepping for an interview to become a tutor. I'll be
                    tutoring students in boot camps like the one I just completed (Full Stack Software Development). I'm
                    pretty excited about this opportunity for a number of reasons.
                </p>
                <p>First, I get to help people. That's my jam! But also, I get to learn. Yes, I'm tutoring students new to
                    software development, but I'll be learning. Or at least, I'd better be learning! I don't believe that
                    learning is ever complete, no matter how much education you have or how old you are. Life is a school,
                    and every experience I have is teaching me new things about the world -- incidentally, I LOVE that!!
                </p>

                <p>So I'm developing some curriculum of my own, to be able to illustrate lessons the way I can best convey
                    them. That's fun, because I get to be creative.
                </p>

                <p>At the same time, I still need to keep learning about testing, PWAs, mobile app development, etc., etc.
                    There's so much to keep learning! That's one of the benefits of learning development and programming,
                    in my opinion. I can usually look at a job and see the point at which I'll have mastered it and then get
                    bored with it. But I don't see that with development. I also don't see that with coaching. I am SO
                    anxious to get into coaching development teams! I just can't wait! I need experience with development and
                    then I can move into management of dev teams, and eventually coaching dev teams.
                </p>

                <p>It just can't happen fast enough.  </p>

                <h1 class="rainbow">Testing -- Bug lifecycle and Black box/White box testing </h1>
                <h4>My first basic learning steps in testing</h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 27, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>I've starting learning some things about testing, and want to write about what I've learned (to reinforce
                    the learning).
                </p>
                <p><em><strong>Bug Testing</strong></em>:  This is pretty self-explanatory once you look at it. Obviously,
                    someone needs to report a bug, and that's when it gets put into a tracking system as "new". Then it
                    is assigned to a developer, who changes the status to "active" if they believe it is truly a bug, and
                    "rejected" if they don't. The latter may be the case if a QA Tester doesn't understand the requirements
                    or if the feature is working, just not as the tester expected. If the bug is accepted and active, the
                    developer works on a fix and then tests the feature. If it fails at this point, the bug can be reopened
                    and goes back into the flow as "active"; if it passes, the status is changed to "verified" and then it's
                    closed.
                </p>
                <p><em><strong>Black box testing</strong></em>:  this type of testing is performed when the tester does not
                    know the "inner workings" of the feature. Examples of black box testing include: equivalence testing
                    (representatives from each partition are selected), boundary testing (edge cases, and cases on either side
                    of the partitions), decision tables (created using the test conditions to build a matrix of possible outcomes),
                    state transition (when the feature changes state, like login/logout), and use cases (specific scenarios).
                </p>
                <p><em><strong>White box testing</strong></em>:  this type of testing is performed when the tester understands and
                    knows the inner code and how the feature is built by the developer. Examples of white box testing include unit testing
                    and statement testing.
                </p>

                <h1 class="rainbow">Scrum & Agile are what floats my boat</h1>
                <h4>All the feels </h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 20, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>Although I have been studying software development for a bit under a year, I came to it somewhat
                    reluctantly. I started this part of my journey because I am driven to be a Scrum Master or development
                    team coach. After obtaining certification as a Scrum Master, I wasn't able to find a job and I asked around
                    to other SMs as to why, and their answer was that I needed development experience first. So that's what
                    I've been doing for the last year or so. I can admit that
                    as much as I enjoy development, it is not my passion. Helping people is my passion. And I guess I feel like
                    building apps doesn't achieve quite the tangible impact that I want to have. (not that there's anything wrong
                    with dev being your jam, if it is)

                </p>
                <p>Coaching is my peanut butter AND jam. I've gone from coaching one CEO, to coaching individuals in my private
                    practice (I was coaching gifted adults), and now I want to coach development teams. Supporting a team
                    allows me to use emotional intelligence to help others -- and I get to use intuition, common sense,
                    curiosity, and problem solving to do it. If I can make a team member feel good by feeling supported
                    and respected, I also get to feel good, and we both win. When that team member feels good, they can
                    do their very best work, which makes the client feel good.  Win-win-win!!
                </p>
                <p>One of the most important aspects of scrum is that the scrum master is a servant leader. That means truly
                    serving the people you're supporting. In my position leading a nonprofit, that meant finding board members
                    and then giving the everything they needed in order to be successful, from helping them define goals to
                    overcoming challenges in achieving those goals. In parenting, that means telling my kids that they can do
                    something and then letting them do it! Servant Leadership involves trust, respect, and empathy; it takes
                    patience, creates space for mistakes and learning from those mistakes, and relies on the assumption
                    that we are all doing our best.
                </p>

                <p>Doesn't that sound awesome??
                </p>

                <h1 class="rainbow">Bootcamps *le sigh* </h1>
                <h4>My experience left me lacking . . .</h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 19, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>I just finished a bootcamp in Full Stack Software Development, and you may know about the challenges that
                    this can create for a new developer. Yes, many developers these days are self-taught and plenty have received
                    their education through bootcamps. There are apprenticeships, bootcamps, online learning, library books,
                    YouTube, and (I'm sure) a billion more ways to learn how to code. As a recent graduate looking for a job,
                    I want to know how competitive I am and what skills I'm lacking. I'm a huge fan of Agile, so I always want to
                    be iterating and improving my knowledge base. Learning doesn't stop (like, ever) for me.
                </p>
                <p>So when I was looking around at other methods of education for a developer, I was noticing that my bootcamp
                    experience left a few holes in my education. The full time, immersive
                    bootcamp experience is a glorified glossing-over of basic subjects and (in my opinion) some topics that are
                    not necessarily essential. In other words, I felt like less time should be spent on things like Handlebars and
                    more time on deeper investigation of bigger topics like JavaScript and React. Although JavaScript was essentially
                    used after the second week, it wasn't really taught in depth. And React received all of two weeks (the first was
                    instruction, the second was final project time).

                </p>
                <p>Other than the lack of depth, one of the major holes in my experience was in testing. There was zero
                    teaching about testing. So I'll be filling in that gap myself, by learning about mobile, backend, and web testing,
                    and generally the subject of QA testing. I hope to cover JIRA and Confluence, and hopefully more. I'll
                    write about testing as soon as I have learned a bit.  :)

                <h4>My own personal Scrum</h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 18, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>Yesterday, I had jury duty and I had previously taken the weekend off (beginning Friday), so I'm feeling
                    a bit rusty right now. Yes, taking four days off can leave me feeling rusty.
                </p>
                <p>At any rate, here's what I'm up to: I got my blog written up in html/css and started writing a few posts.
                    I'll leave posts about OOP/FP and code conventions for tomorrow and the next day.
                    Today, I'll probably need to get started on either a review of full stack basic principles or get
                    started on learning testing methods and software. Both are large tasks. I would estimate that a full stack
                    review will take me one week, and learning testing will also take me one week. I may have to rock-paper-scissors
                    to make a decision.

                </p>
                <p>Challenges I'm facing include: the scroll bar at the bottom of my website is really bugging me, and
                    I need to decide on what to do next and then start it.</p>

                <h1 class="rainbow">Tackling a Topic one thought at a time</h1>
                <h4>HTML, CSS, and JS</h4>
                <h5><em>Date: June 18, 2019</em></h5>

                <p>This discussion is about the basic trinity of web development:  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is
                    where the journey begins; it is the structure or the scaffolding on which we build a web page or an app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML is, of course, an acronym. Side note: learning to code is no different from learning medicine, in that
                    it is basically learning a new language. Every new language has its own precarious set of acronyms.
                    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it consists of tags that determine what will be placed
                    on the page in the browser. It's not fancy, but it's the backbone of anything you see on the web; it is the
                    starting place for any and all websites, web pages, and web applications. HTML may seem simple, but
                    it is essential for any web page to "work" (i.e. be seen by the user).
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS, (also an acronym) stands for Custom Styling Sheets, and it is how we create a bit of zhoosh for the
                    HTML we have. CSS is the sparkle, the glitter, and the icing on the cake. It allows us to place
                    elements in special locations on the page, change colors and fonts, and basically
                    transform boring cake into a work of art. To learn more about CSS, I have delved into a few different
                    ways to use it, like SCSS and BEM. I'll profile those in another article.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript (JS) is where things start to get real (and complex). JS allows users to interact with
                    the web page or application (HTML and CSS create static content -- it's not interactive).
                    JS makes buttons clickable, allows content to be dynamically updated, and animates images.

                    If we go a step beyond the "holy trinity", we find APIs (Application Programming Interface). APIs are
                    the zhoosh to JavaScript -- they create extra power and functionality to JS by using additional code. It's like
                    borrowing someone else's Legos to build your house (but the Legos are reusable and can be shared
                    around the world).

                    Ok, this was just a basic surface-scratching post, to get things started. My creative juices are
                    in desperate need of refreshing, because technical writing is turning out to be harder than I had
                    anticipated it would be.

                <p>I am going to write about the topics I'm learning. I just finished a bootcamp in Full Stack
                    Software Development, but I don't feel like I have all the knowledge that I should. So as I learn
                    those topics, I'll write about them here (to solidify the learning). When I was in medical school, the
                    basic teaching methodology was "see one, do one, teach one." I guess this is just my "teach one" forum.

                I am Nikki Petersen. I live in the Denver metro area and I have spent a little less than a year teaching
                myself Software Development. My experience includes: HTML/CSS, Bootstrap,
                JavaScript, JQuery, Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, Mongo/Mongoose, Handlebars,
                EJS, React, and a handful of other random packages/libraries/etc. I spend my professional free
                time continually learning. Right now, I'm adding testing methods and practices to my skillset.
                Personal free time is spent outdoors with my kids, learning and creating and generally engaging in
                shenanigans.
                <br><br>

                On a more personal note:  the last year or so has been a huge growth spurt for me, in terms of self-awareness.
                After being married to a man for 10-ish years, divorcing him, and then his death, I was finally able to come
                out and be myself for the first time since childhood. It seems like a lot of women have recently been coming out after
                being married and having children, and I have to say that my experience has been comparatively smooth. I'm lucky to have great
                friends who support me no matter what (unconditional love ftw), and I've never had to deal with the chaos of
                coming out to my horrible ex and his horrible family. So many women coming out late in life have very
                different outcomes. For me, it's been humbling to be so loved and cared for by my friends and family. Love is love.
                I often like to represent my journey with a "backward" rainbow of hearts because I've come out in a sort of
                reverse order, having lived one life for so long and finally being able to be my full self.</p>
